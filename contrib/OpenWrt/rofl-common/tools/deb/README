How to use
==========

Execute as:

	sh# cd build/
	sh# ../tools/deb/checkinstall_gen.sh 

If you want to overwrite the required packages:
	sh# export REQUIRES="<pkg_name1, pkg_name2...>"; ../tools/deb/checkinstall_gen.sh 

Required packages for rofl/rofl-dbg pkg
=======================================

Note that for ROFL without SSL there is no particular package requirement.

To have SSL support, the code MUST be compiled with SSL support (check required packages and make sure configure detects SSL and its compiled in), and the packages rofl/rofl-dbg would therefore require:

- Debian 7.X, Ubuntu 14.04 (at least):  libssl1.0.0, libcrypto++9
- Add more here..
