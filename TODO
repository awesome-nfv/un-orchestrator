When there is a missing semicolon in the rules list on a NF-FG file, it
is still considered valid but all the rules after the missing semicolon are ignored.

example:

{"id":"00000199",	"match":{"port":"dpdk1"},				"action":{"VNF_id":"502_forwarder:2"}	},
{"id":"00000200",	"match":{"VNF_id":"501_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"VNF_id":"500_forwarder:2"}	}
{"id":"00000201",	"match":{"VNF_id":"502_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"VNF_id":"501_forwarder:2"}	},
{"id":"00000300",	"match":{"VNF_id":"500_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"port":"dpdk0"}				}

In this case all the rules from 200 are ignored.
