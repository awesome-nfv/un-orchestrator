The examples in orchestrator/config must be updated to the new nf-fg.

Mauricio (26-Jan-2016)
When there is a missing semicolon in the rules list on a NF-FG file, it
is still considered valid but all the rules after the missing semicolon are ignored.

example:

{"id":"00000199",	"match":{"port":"dpdk1"},				"action":{"VNF_id":"502_forwarder:2"}	},
{"id":"00000200",	"match":{"VNF_id":"501_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"VNF_id":"500_forwarder:2"}	}
{"id":"00000201",	"match":{"VNF_id":"502_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"VNF_id":"501_forwarder:2"}	},
{"id":"00000300",	"match":{"VNF_id":"500_forwarder:1"},	"action":{"port":"dpdk0"}				}

In this case all the rules from 200 are ignored.

*******************************************************************************
VLAN Endpoint does not work properly.
Traffic coming from an endpoint of this type (tagged) is not correctly matched and the vlan tag is not popped. 
On the other hand, traffic directed to an endpoint of this type is not tagged (the problem should be on the actions order)

Not all flows are deleted when a graph is deleted.
