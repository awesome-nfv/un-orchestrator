This folder contains all the docker containers necessary to deploy an elastic router.

The name-resolver is configured using example_er.xml.
It can be deployed by using the virtualizer version of the un-orchestrator and send the er_nffg.json NFFG file to it.  

This version uses the JSON nffg version to send to the UN cf-or interface.
