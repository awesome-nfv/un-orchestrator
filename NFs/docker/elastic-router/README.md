This folder contains all the VNFs to deploy an elastic router.
It can be deployed by the un-orchestrator with the correct NFFG file.  
Also the name-resolver needs to have an entry for these VNFs.

1. `ctrl`: this is the control app VNF
2. `ovs` : this is the data plane ovs VNF

All other related files for the deployment are located in:
