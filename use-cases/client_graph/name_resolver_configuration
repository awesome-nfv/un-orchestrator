		This is an example of configuration file for the name-resolver. For each
		network function name, it contains a list of possible implementations for
		that network function. 
		
		An implementation can be:
		* a 'docker' container
		* a 'dpdk' (secondary) process
		* a 'kvm' virtual machine
		* a 'native' native functionality
		
		In case of docker container, the file specifies the URI from which the
		image of this container can be downloaded. 
		
		In case of dpdk (secondary) process, the file specifies the URI from which
		the executable can be retrieved and the number of cores required by the
		network function. Since the URI can be a web URL or a path on the local file
		system, the file also specifies to interpret the URI through the attribute
		location.
		
		In case of KVM virtual machine, the file specifies an URI that points to an XML 
		Libvirt domain definition, which the orchestrator uses as a template for the 
		creation and execution of the network function.
		
		In case of native functionality, the file specifies the URI from which
		the script or executable can be retrieved and the list of dependencies required
		by the network function. Since the URI can be a web URL or a path on the local file
		system, the file also specifies to interpret the URI through the attribute
		location.
