# Universal Node Use Cases

This folder contains the files required to demonstrate the UN in some real use cases.
In particular, it includes:

  * the configuration files for the UN (orchestrator, name resolver, etc)
  * (possibly) all the VNFs, properly configured for that use case (e.g., through a Dockerfile)

**Important**: those use cases may not work immediately in your network environment, e.g., because of a different  physical setup (e.g., network interfaces available on the UN, IP addresses, etc).
However, they represent an easier start to demonstrate the UN at work.
