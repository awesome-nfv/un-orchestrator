# Porting of the UN to the OpenWRT platform

This document contains the instructions required to compile the UN for the OpenWRT platform.

**Warning**: The current status of the porting is very preliminary; not all the components have been compiled so far, nor we are sure that the software behaves properly. Therefore this document should be intended as an initial proof-of-concept.
