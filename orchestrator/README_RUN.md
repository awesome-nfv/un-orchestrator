# How to launch the un-orchestrator

The full list of command line parameters for the un-orchestrator can be
retrieved by the following command:

    $ sudo ./node-orchestrator --h

Please refer to the help provided by the un-orchestrator itself in order to
understand how to use the different options.

The un-orchestrator requires a virtual switch up and running in the server,
which is completely independent from this software.
Therefore you need to start your preferred vSwitch first, before running
the un-orchestrator. Proper instructions for Open vSwich, ERFS and xDPd are provided
below.

Similarly, the un-orchestrator requires that the datastore is already running; 
please, refer to the instructions provided in [../datastore](../datastore) 
to understand how to execute this component.

### Configuration file examples

Folder `config` contains some configuration file examples that can be used
to configure/test the un-orchestrator.

  * [config/default-config.ini](config/default-config.ini): 
    configuration file for the un-orchestrator. It allows to specify information such 
    as the TCP port used by the REST server, the list of physical interfaces of 
    the Universal Node, and more;
  * [config/simple_passthrough_nffg.json](config/simple_passthrough_nffg.json): 
    simple graph that implements a simple passthrough function, i.e., traffic is 
    received from a first physical port and sent out from a second physical port, 
    after having been handled to the vswitch;
  * [config/passthrough_with_vnf_nffg.json](config/passthrough_with_vnf_nffg.json): 
    graph that includes a VNF. Traffic is received from a first physical port, provided
    to a network function, and then sent out from a second physical port.

## How to start the proper virtual switch

As stated above, the proper vSwitch must be started on the Universal Node before the boot of the
un-orchestrator; in the following the instructions to run the supported vSwitches are provided.

### How to start OvS (managed through OVSDB) to work with the un-orchestrator

Start OVS:

    $ sudo /usr/share/openvswitch/scripts/ovs-ctl start

Start ovsdb-server:

    $ sudo ovs-appctl -t ovsdb-server ovsdb-server/add-remote ptcp:6632
	
### How to start OvS (managed through OVSDB) with DPDK support to work with the un-orchestrator

Configure the system (after each reboot of the physical machine):

    $ sudo su
    ; Set the huge pages of 2MB; 4096 huge pages should be reasonable.
    $ echo 4096 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
	
    ; Umount previous hugepages dir
    $ umount /dev/hugepages
    $ rm -r /dev/hugepages
	
    ; Mount huge pages directory
    $ mkdir /dev/hugepages
    $ mount -t hugetlbfs nodev /dev/hugepages
    
    $ exit
	
Set up DPDK (after each reboot of the physical machine):

    $ sudo modprobe uio
    $ sudo insmod [dpdk-folder]/x86_64-ivshmem-linuxapp-gcc/kmod/igb_uio.ko
    ; Bind the physical network device to `igb_uio`. The following row
    ; shows how to bind eth1. Repeat the command for each network interface
    ; you want to bind.
    $ sudo [dpdk-folder]/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio eth1

Start `ovsdb-server`:

    $ sudo ovsdb-server --remote=punix:/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock \
        --remote=db:Open_vSwitch,Open_vSwitch,manager_options --remote=ptcp:6632  --pidfile --detach
	
The first time after the ovsdb database creation, initialize it:

    $ sudo ovs-vsctl --no-wait init

Start the switching daemon:	

    $ export DB_SOCK=/usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock
    $ sudo ovs-vswitchd --dpdk -c 0x1 -n 4 --socket-mem 1024,0 \
        -- unix:$DB_SOCK --pidfile --detach


### How to start ERFS with DPDK support to work with the un-orchestrator

Set up DPDK (after each reboot of the physical machine), in order to:

  * Insert `IGB UIO` kernel module;
  * Set up huge page filesystem;
  * Bind Ethernet devices to IGB UIO module (bind all the Ethernet interfaces that you want to use).

Start ERFS with the following commands:

    $ cd [erfs]
    $ sudo ./dof [dpdk parameters] -- [erfs parameters]
    ; example: ./dof -c 0xe -n 2 -- -p 6633 -c example.cfg -C 1

DPDK parameters are the usual ones: core mask or list, memory channels, socket memories, etc.
ERFS parameters can be seen in the README file available in the ERFS repository.
There are no mandatory parameters.

ERFS comes with a run-time configuration interface and also with configuration file support. 
Configuration commands can be sent to the switch either on this TCP port
(default control port number - 1 = 16632), or by using a file, and adding
the `-c <filename>` to the command line.

    add-switch dpid=<dpid>

        Create a new switch with the specified data path id. A new control
        port is also opened for it, starting from port number specified on
        the command line (or 16633).

    add-port dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum> PCI:x:y.z [rx-queues=<q>]

        Add a physical port with the specified PCI id to a switch.
        Specifying the number of RX queues is optional (default = 1).

    add-port dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum> XSWITCH

        Add an "inter-switch" port to a switch. Using this port
        packets can  be sent between two switches. See the "connect" command.
        The name of the port will be: XSWITCH:<dpid>-<OF pnum>

    add-port dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum> KNI:<iface_id> socket=<s>

        Add a KNI port to a switch. <iface_id> should be a unique number,
        as the interface name the kernel will see is: "kni<iface_id>"
        <s> is the NUMA socket number to be used for the queues of the port.

    add-port dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum> IVSHMEM socket=<s>

        Add an IVSHMEM port to a switch. The port name will be:
        IVSHMEM:<dpid>-<OF pnum>. IVSHMEM groups should be grouped, see
        "group-ivshmems".
        <s> is the NUMA socket number to be used for the queues of the port.

    add-port dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum> DEFRAG buckets=<b>

        Add an IP defragmenter virtual port to the switch.
        The port name will be: DEFRAG:<dpid>-<OF pnum>
        Packets sent to the port will reappear in table 0 with their
        original inport, and metadata set to 1.

    connect XSWITCH:<dpid1>-<num1> XSWITCH:<dpid2>-<num2>

        Connect two inter switch ports. Packets sent to XSWITCH:<dpid1>-<num1>
        will appear as input on XSWITCH:<dpid2>-<num2>. The lcore which
        processed the packet in the dpid1 switch continues processing in the
        dpid2 switch too.

    group-ivshmems <metadata_name> IVSHMEM:<dpid>-<num1> IVSHMEM:<dpid>-<num2> ...

        Group a set of IVSHMEM ports to be used by a single VM. This command
        generates the necessary command line for Qemu in a file:
        /tmp/ivshmem_qemu_cmdline_<metadata_name>

    lcore <lcore> PCI:x:y.z[/queue] | IVSHMEM:<dpid>-<num> | KNI:<num>

        Specify which ports/queues an lcore should read.

    defrag-stat dpid=<dpid> port-num=<OF pnum>

        Returns detailed statistics from the specified defragmenter port.

    plugin <path_of_shared_library>

        Loads a shared library implementing experimental actions/instructions.


### How to start xDPd with DPDK support to work with the un-orchestrator

Set up DPDK (after each reboot of the physical machine), in order to:

  * Build the environment `x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc`
  * Insert `IGB UIO` module
  * Insert `KNI` module
  * Setup hugepage mappings for non-NUMA systems (1000 should be a reasonable number)
  * Bind Ethernet devices to `IGB UIO` module (bind all the ethernet interfaces that you want to use)
 
    $ cd [xdpd]/libs/dpdk/tools  
    $ sudo ./setup.sh  
    ; Follow the instructions provided in the script

Start xDPd:

	$ cd [xdpd]/build/src/xdpd
	$ sudo ./xdpd

xDPd comes with a command line tool called `xcli`, that can be used to check
the  flows installed in the LSIs, which are the LSIs deployed, see statistics
on flows matched, and so on. The `xcli` can be run by just typing:

    $ xcli


## How to start the proper virtual execution environment

Only Libvirt needs to be explicitly started. If you do not intend 
to use this execution environment, you can skip this section.

### How to configure and start libvirt

In case you are planning to use OvS with DPDK support as virtual switch, you have 
to edit the file `/usr/local/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf` by adding the following line:

        hugetlbfs_mount = "/dev/hugepages"

Regardless of the virtual switch used, you have now to stop any running `libvirt` 
instance and run the alternative version installed:

	$ sudo service libvirt-bin stop
	$ sudo /usr/local/sbin/libvirtd --daemon
	
Similarly, if you use `virsh`, you would have to use the version from `/usr/local/bin`.
